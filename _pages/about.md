Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in the [Evaluation, Statistics, & Methodology](https://epc.utk.edu/evaluation-statistics-measurement/) program in the [Educational Psychology and Counseling Department](https://epc.utk.edu/) at The University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I am also an affiliated faculty member with the Intercollegiate Graduate Statistics and Data Science Program ([IGSDSP](https://haslam.utk.edu/business-analytics-statistics/masters/statistics/participating-programs)). I earned a PhD in Educational Psychology and Research specializing in Quantitative Methods in Educational Research from The University of Memphis. 

I teach graduate-level courses in applied statistics and psychometrics. In my scholarly work, I apply quantitative methods to solve substantive issues in educational research. I have published my work in a variety of journals including *The Quantitative Methods for Psychology*, *Higher Education*, *Numeracy*, *Research in Higher Education*, *Research and Practice in Assessment*, *The Review of Higher Education*, *School Psychology Review*, and the *Journal of Diversity in Higher Education*. My specific research interests include program evaluation and assessment in higher education and methodological issues in educational research.
